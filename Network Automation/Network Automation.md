# Use Cases
Generating configuration backups

Ensuring there are no duplicate IP addresses in the network

Validating that all OSPF speakers have unique RIDs, and peers are in the "FULL" state

Testing that each adjacent network node is on the same subnet

Validating that all devices comply with the company baseline policy (must be running a specific software version, firewall rules are compliant, etc.)

Checking the health of network devices (high CPU utilization, memory use, etc.)

Testing that all interfaces configured with IP addresses are in the "UP" state

And much, much more...

# Which of the following best describes "configuration drift"?
- Generating a device's configuration using programming languages
- Updating configurations using an out-of-band channel
- Gradual changes over time that result in the running configuration diverging from the intended configuration => Correct
- Fully replacing a device's running configuration
