# Use Cases
Generating configuration backups

Ensuring there are no duplicate IP addresses in the network

Validating that all OSPF speakers have unique RIDs, and peers are in the "FULL" state

Testing that each adjacent network node is on the same subnet

Validating that all devices comply with the company baseline policy (must be running a specific software version, firewall rules are compliant, etc.)

Checking the health of network devices (high CPU utilization, memory use, etc.)

Testing that all interfaces configured with IP addresses are in the "UP" state

And much, much more...
