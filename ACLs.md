# 1. ACLs Concepts
## Key Points
Default Behavior: Traffic not explicitly permitted is denied by default.

Ordering: ACL entries are processed top-down.

Steps to Implement: 1) Plan 2) Create List 3) Apply to interface

## Purpose
Filter network traffic on a router, controlling what gets forwarded and what gets blocked = Your Network's Security Guard

## How it works
Router: The gated community

ACL: List of permitted/denied visitors held by the security guard

Traffic: People trying to enter/exit

## How to do
Plan: Determine what traffic to filter (permit/deny)

Create List: Write ACL entries specifying the traffic types.

Apply: Attach the ACL to a router interface (inbound/outbound).

## Router's Behavior
Checks each packet against the ACL entries in order.

If a match is found, action is taken (permit or deny).

If no match is found, the packet is implicitly denied.


# 2. Standard ACLs

## Purpose
Basic IP address-based traffic filtering on a router.

Standard ACLs have an implicit deny any any at the end. If no ACL entry matches, the packet is dropped!

Use the "host" keyword to specify individual IP addresses.

Access lists are processed in order â€“ the first match determines the permit/deny action.

## Limitations:

Can only match based on source IP address. Cannot filter based on destination address, protocols (TCP, UDP, etc.), or port numbers.

## Basic ACL Structure

### Plan:

Define what traffic to permit/deny based on its source IP address.

### Create:

(config)# access-list [number 1-99] [permit | deny] [source address] 

Example:

(config)# access-list 1 deny host 10.16.0.10

(config)# access-list 1 permit any 

### Apply:

(config-if)# ip access-group [number 1-99] [in | out]

## Commands

access-list [number] [permit | deny] [source address] - Creates an ACL entry

ip access-group [number] [in | out] - Applies ACL to a router interface in the specified direction.
