VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol)
What is VTP?

Stands for VLAN Trunk Protocol (sometimes VLAN Trunking Protocol)
Used to synchronize VLAN information across multiple switches in a network
Why is VTP important?

Without VTP, VLANs need to be configured individually on each switch.
If a VLAN doesn't exist on a switch in the traffic path, frames belonging to that VLAN will be dropped.
VTP simplifies VLAN management by allowing changes made on one switch to propagate to others.
How does VTP work?

Switches are grouped into a VTP domain.
A domain can have a shared password for security.
VTP information is exchanged over existing trunk links.
Each domain tracks a configuration revision number. Changes made on a switch increase its revision number.
Switches synchronize with others that have a higher configuration revision number, ensuring everyone has the latest VLAN information.
VTP Modes:

Server: Can create, delete, and modify VLANs. Changes are propagated to other switches in the domain.
Client: Receives and applies VLAN information from a server. Cannot make local changes to the VLAN database.
Transparent: Forwards VTP messages but doesn't participate in VLAN synchronization. Local VLAN changes are allowed but not propagated.
Off: Disables VTP completely. No VTP messages are processed or forwarded.
Important Considerations:

Accidental Deletions: Be careful when deleting VLANs, as they will be removed from all switches in the domain. Use client mode to prevent accidental deletions on non-administrative switches.
New Switch Integration: Ensure new switches have a lower configuration revision number than the existing domain before connecting. Set the new switch to transparent mode initially to avoid overwriting the domain's VLAN database.
Example Scenario:

Four switches (SW1, SW2, SW3, SW4) in the same VTP domain.
SW1 is a server, SW2 & SW4 are clients, SW3 is transparent.
Adding a new VLAN on SW1 will update SW2 & SW4, but not SW3.
Deleting a VLAN on SW4 will result in an error because it's in client mode.
Key Takeaway:
VTP simplifies VLAN management but requires careful configuration to avoid unintended consequences. Understanding VTP modes and configuration revision numbers is crucial for successful implementation.
